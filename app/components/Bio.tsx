        <p className='p-title mt-6'>I’m a 3rd year Japanese major student at <a className='underlined-body link-noapply' href='https://www.arts.chula.ac.th/th/' target='_blank'>Chulalongkorn University</a> with a strong passion for <a className='underlined-body'>web development</a> and <a className='underlined-body'>UI Design</a>. Coding excites me because it allows me to bring creative ideas to life while maintaining structure and organization, which I truly enjoy</p>
        <p className='p-title mt-3'>Outside of programming, one of my favorite hobbies is playing <a className='underlined-body'>Karuta</a>, a traditional Japanese card game. I’m also an active member of the Bangkok Karuta Club, where I get to engage with others who share this interest.</p>
        <p className='p-title mt-3'>Additionally, I have a growing interest in <a className='underlined-body'>religious studies</a> and <a className='underlined-body'>philosophy</a>, particularly Buddhist philosophy. I plan to include topics related to philosophy on this site, so you can get to know me better and see the various aspects of who I am.</p>
        <p className='p-title mt-3'>I’m always eager to explore new opportunities for learning and personal growth, <a className='underlined-body'>so feel free to reach out to me anytime!</a></p>
